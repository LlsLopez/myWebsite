      Game is currently unnamed.<br>
      This python based program is being created using pygame. In this game you play as a dragon,
      using WASD to control your character. Dodge incoming attacks from enemies, with varying
      bullet trajectories / attack patterns, as well as avoiding surrounding objects. Enemies,
      powerups, and objects are spawned in infinitely, with slight (randomly generated) variations in timing.
      <br> *Sprites/animatons and any artwork is temporary while completing, and not my own original work. <br>

      This mini application was created using java (Gui). It feautures
      a simple screen selection (second image in the slide), asking players which color they which to choose.
      It then goes to the second panel, where players take turns placing their color on top of a column by clicking
      on the respective X above.Game functions normally with all possible win conditions and draw detection. Game ends
      when either of these circumstances are met, or manually reset by file option.<br>

      <div id="project_name">Blackjack Ai</div>
      This application was created between myself and three other members for a class project. Using
      python, we created an AI blackjack player who would determine the best statistical strategy to profiting
      in a standard game of blackjack. The "player" had no knowledge of the cards left, and used the method
      of "card counting" in order to determine the best possible move. Using statistics and basic mathematics,
      the bot was able to weigh potential gain and the probability of winning the next hand to
      determine whether to bet high, and if it should hit/double. The player starts with $10,000, and the
      program runs for 1,000 games, then displays the results. Because it is all luck based, and house favoured,
      the player is still likely to lose, however less often.<br>

      This simple chat bot application was created for a mock assignment, where a company
      needed a bot (for their website) to answer frequent concerns, negating the need for a human representative
      to answer. This program was created using c++, with simple string reading, allowing for the detection
      of specific key words, such as "cancel" and "subscription" in the same text field, which would then return
      the appropriate answer. It is in very early stages, as their were set questions which needed to be answered,
      and no deeper leveled questions.

      This project was a collaborated website with several other teammates (from a course). The goal of this
      website was to create a "one stop shop" for all useful utilities. This included useful website links to
      popular websites, such as stack overflow, useful created application (calculators), and even "for fun" sections,
      such as flash game (some originally created by myself/ group). While in reality this website does not hold
      as much use, the main purpose of this project was to practice important real world skills, such as scrumming and
      working with
      larger groups, and following models like waterfall and agile. <br>
