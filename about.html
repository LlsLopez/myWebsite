  <div id="about_details">
    The purpose of this website was to practice and demonstrate my capabilities in creating
    a website without the use of a website builder. Furthermore it allows me to showcase some of
    my past projects, as well as corresponding direct links to source code. I will be able to
    continuously update the site as I gain more experience, as well as periodically upgrade areas
    which may not be written optimally. The main function is to serve as a personal portfolio. <br>
    This website is created using mostly html/css, with some javascript for the background. The
    background is made using .gltf models, with the use of the ThreeJs library.
